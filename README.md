With the given a dataset, composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses, I have written JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * I have tracked what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then found the average.

* The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
